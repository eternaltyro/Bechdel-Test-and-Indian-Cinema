# Bechdel-Test-and-Indian-Cinema
Movies, TV Series, Web Series that passed Bechdel Test.

The basic test has the following criteria:

1. The movie has to have at least two women in it
2. who talk to each other
3. about something besides a man. 

For the sake of practicality I'm including the following criteria as well :

1. These two women should be named characters.
2. Do the women talk to each other about something besides a  man for more than 60 seconds?
